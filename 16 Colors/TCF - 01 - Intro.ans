[13C[35m ARTWORK

[37m[14CI have numbered my contributions to the artpack.  I attempted
[14Cto put them in to some sort of order where you can take time
[14Cviewing them and experience the diversity between styles, also,
[14Cpics or fonts.

[14CI recommend you use PabloDraw 2.0.8 to view the artpack.
[14CWe are drawing in Windows now and it might seem blasphemous
[14Cbut with a constant VGA preview window available it is a factor
[14Cand is taken into account during production. You should also
[14Cview ANSi's with both views available at the same time.

[14C[1;33mFor my drawing iParent I used blinking colors, if you're
[0m[14C[1;33mviewing with the new Pablo 3.1.2 ensure you have ice colors off
[0m[14C[1;33mso the blinks will work. It's basically not even worth looking
[0m[14C[1;33mat without them because that's not how it was intended.

[0m[13C[35m THANK YOU

[37m[14CThank you for taking time to read this and to be interested
[14Cin the work of others. Like Filth said, you are here, you
[14Care reading this, it means something, this is for you.

[14CI hope you enjoy the artwork and the time we spent
[14Ccreating pieces in a medium that people considered to be
[14Cdead or dying 17 years ago.
